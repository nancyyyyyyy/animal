	<h2>Description of JackChi</h2>
		<p>The Jack Chi is not a purebred dog. It is a cross between the Chihuahua and the Jack Russell Terrier. The best way to determine the temperament of a mixed breed is to look up all breeds in the cross and know you can get any combination of any of the characteristics found in either breed. Not all of these designer hybrid dogs being bred are 50% purebred to 50% purebred. It is very common for breeders to breed multi-generation crosses.</p>
	<h2> Reasons <i>to</i>Fall In Love</h2>
		<p>The Jack Chi makes a great family dog. They typically love to play with other dogs and cats. Care should be taken when they are around small children due to size and hyper activity of the dog.</p>
	<h2>Personality</h2>
		<p> The Jack Chi is a loving, friendly, and playful dog.The Chihuahua Jack Russell Terrier will usually be a little smaller than a typical Jack Russell purebred. It's not uncommon for a Jack Russell Chihuahua to be shorter than 10 inches (at the shoulders). Ears can either have the Chihuahua stiff pointiness or the Jack Russell curl-over. The Chihuahua has a thinner muzzle than the JRT, so this trait can also show up in the Chihuahua Jack Russell mix.
